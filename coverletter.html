                                Looking for a creative and knowledgeable person? Search no further because I am ready
                                for the job. <br/><br/>

                                I believe that, with my skills, motivation and attitudes, I can bring a lot to the
                                company and am excited about the prospect. My background is in anthropology but last
                                year I have turned my focus to web design and development and hope to develop my career
                                further within IT or design agency/company.<br/><br/>

                                During my anthropological studies I went to several fieldwork where I conducted
                                different researches. Through fieldwork I sought a detailed and intimate understanding
                                of the context of social action and relations. I gained knowledge how to assemble data
                                in numerous ways. All the time I have worked with systematic approaches to qualitative
                                and quantitative analysis of different aspects of anthropology. I am really experienced
                                in gathering qualitative data by conducting individual and group interviews and through
                                participant observation.<br/><br/>

                                Most recently, I have worked on a huge project “Challenging the crisis” which lasted 3
                                years. Being a part of a project I experienced ups and downs and completely understood
                                what means to be a good team player with strong leader. I gained skills, such as, how to
                                negotiate with policy makers, how to have a good presentation of your ideas and
                                statements so others start to listen and support you. I had the opportunity to practice
                                and develop social skills and work in international environment.<br/><br/>

                                As a head waitress I gained precious experience because I had to earn respect so
                                employees listened me. I had to act professionally by dressing appropriately, coming to
                                work and meeting on time, and communicating in a professional manner. I had to be clear
                                about rules and expectations. I learned to ask my co-workers for feedback and also
                                reward a good work.<br/><br/>

                                In year 2016 I gained diploma in web design and development. My particular skills
                                include HTML5, CSS3 and Sass. On front-end and back-end I use programming language
                                JavaScript and JS libraries such as EJS, jQuery, jQuery mobile, d3.js and full stack
                                JavaScript framework MEAN – MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS. I did a few
                                minimalistic projects and simple Ionic mobile TO-DO app. Within Comtrade summer school I
                                acquainted with the development of Android applications, the Java programming language
                                and Android Studio. I know how to set up a VPS server, I am also familiar with Linux. <br/><br/>

                                I understand the importance of staying up-to-date on industry trends and technologies,
                                and make it my priority. I went to few seminars about digital marketing and gained
                                general knowledge about search engine optimization, search engine marketing and
                                importance of social networks.<br/><br/>

                                As a team player who can fit into any position in your office on a needs basis, I am
                                very confident that I can make a positive contribution to your company. In addition, I
                                am innovative, a strong decision maker, and have excellent communication skills in
                                Slovene, Croatian and English language.
